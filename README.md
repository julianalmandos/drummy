Drummy is a web application that lets you play the drums with your keyboard.

## Information

This app has been made with Vanilla JS as part of my learning path. It's been really useful to remember some basic concepts that are sometimes forgotten when working with big frontend frameworks.  

The original idea was taken from the first exercise of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), a course from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Latest features

Version 1.0 comes with:
  * Nine customizable sounds to play with.
  * Metronome

## Preview

The app is now live on Netlify: [Drummy](https://drummy.netlify.app/)
